# Machine Learning API Deployment

The objective of this project is to deploy a Machine Learning translation model from the `transformers` library as an API in localhost that can take translation requests using `FastAPI`.


## Future Versions
This project can be made even cooler by: 
* Building a simple frontend to interact with the API
* Building a `/change-model` endpoint with a `PUT` operation  
* Storing API usage logs on a database, and make them available for querying by different parameters in a `metrics/` endpoint using a `GET` operation
* Unit tests section for quality assurance
